about:
  summary: |
    I'm Simon, and I work with technology to solve problems. Every day I seem to discover a new version of what kind of engineer I am. Started as Software, evolved to Operations, then DevOps, Platform, Monitoring, Kubernetes, Cloud, Lead, Architect, Data Engineer, and now ML Systems Engineer. At this rate, I'll probably be a Quantum Blockchain AI Engineer by next Tuesday.

    I like building systems that work reliably at scale. Whether it's automating workflows, designing cloud architecture, or implementing ML pipelines, I focus on practical solutions that teams can actually maintain. I'm comfortable across the full stack, from network configs to distributed systems to ML model deployment.

    Currently fascinated by how ML/AI tooling is changing how we build and operate systems. Always learning, always building, always trying to make things work better than they did yesterday. Strong believer in automation, good documentation, and systems that don't wake you up at 3 AM.

        When I was 12 years old me and a friend of mine decided to create a
        Minecraft(a pretty popular game at that time) server hosting company. At the beggining
        we would host a server off of my parents attic on which we were selling virtual
        currecy, privilages etc.
        
        Later on as we scaled we moved to Hetzner VPS and started offering private
        servers for users. It was a great experience, learned a lot about software
        development (mostly Java). Had a chance to interact on the frontline as a
        forum moderator and in-game administrator. It was working really great for us with
        100-150 people on our servers on average during biggest hype moment for
        Minecraft. This was one of the greatest journeys I have ever experienced.

      I design systems that scale and last. Whether it's artifact management platforms, ML/AI data pipelines, or internal developer tools, I understand requirements, evaluate options, and architect pragmatically. No ivory tower architecture, just practical solutions that teams can maintain and evolve.

      I learn by building. I prototype quickly, validate assumptions, and iterate toward production. I also invest in people, mentoring developers, facilitating cross-team alignment, and ensuring knowledge transfer happens naturally. The best architectures emerge from collaborative conversations, not top-down mandates.
